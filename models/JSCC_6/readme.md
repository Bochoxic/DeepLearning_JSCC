JSCC struct: Successive refinement with JSCC - structure 1

Trained on 50000 * (32/patch_size)^2 patches of Imagenet_a

Stages_count = 5

compression _ratio = 1/48 for each stage

Patch_size = 32

Epochs = 500

Batch_size = 32 * (32/patch_size)^2

Train SNR = 13

Inputs / Outputs pixels range: {0, 1}

raw_model has the model without loss branches and without compilation (easy to load)
